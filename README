Hosted Canvas2D is a hosting service, running on AppEngine, for Canvas2D
based diagrams. It provides a manageable central repository to store Canvas2D
diagrams and serve them in a variety of ways to HTML-enabled media.

Hosted Canvas2D is a brand new implementation of the previous Hosted UmlCanvas
service that provided this service for UmlCanvas based diagrams, an extension
to Canvas2D. Hosted Canvas2D will enable all kinds of Canvas2D based diagrams
to be hosted, thus superseding Hosted UmlCanvas.
